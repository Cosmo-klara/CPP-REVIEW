// Define a class,Point,with demands as follows:
// (1)The class has member data X and Y which describe a point's coordinates.
// (2)Define a member function Distance to get the distance()between two points.
// (3)Define a friend function Distance to get the distance between two points.
// (4)A programmer can use Point in main()as follows:
// void main()
// Point p,q(2,3); // The coordinate of point p is original point.
// cout <p.Distance(q)<<endl;
// cout <Distance(p,q)<<endl;
